# Ecc_Match
Generic code which handles the eccentric match, slightly different from the circular match as two phase angles are analytically maximized over (along with an overall time offset). Includes functions to get SNRS. Requires noise samples. Maximization scheme follows Sec IIIB of arXiv:1903.05203, called the implicit maximization there. 

TODO:Add main w/ example and example samples.
